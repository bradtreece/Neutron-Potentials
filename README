The CMU-Build.tar.gz has the running version I had while working at CMU. It is self-contained and should run, except that there are file paths in the .py that would need updating. This file should not be altered, a universal version is being developed and will be placed on this repository.

The ForceModule folder is also self-contained. ForceModule.py could be imported in python for use outside the collection of files in the folder. Modification of the .namd script will allow for use with other systems, unlike in CMU-Build.tar
    Proposed changes to ForceModule include reading experimental neutron profiles (area.tab) instead of the hand-designed files.
